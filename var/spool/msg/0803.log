@rsato> What the hell was Henry even talking about in today's meeting? I can only take so many buzzwords
@kdunne> I don't know man, I think thermodynamic logistic synergy and/or dual synapse occupation is just an inevitability at this point.
@kdunne> I miss the old UESC.
@rsato> Don't let Marvin hear you say that. That's immediate termination.
@kdunne> I could take him.
@rsato> I don't think you could.

@kdunne> and messed up my audio
